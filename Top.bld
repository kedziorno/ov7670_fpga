INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clkcam', used in period specification
   'TS_clkcam', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_vga. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKDV: <TIMESPEC TS_clk251 = PERIOD "clk251" TS_clkcam * 4 HIGH 50%
   INPUT_JITTER 80 ps>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'ov7670_pclk1', used in period specification
   'TS_ov7670_pclk1', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_pclk1. The following

   output(s):

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:195 - The TNM 'ov7670_pclk2', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMs and will be removed from
   the design.  This TNM is used in the following user groups and/or
   specifications:
   <TIMESPEC TS_ov7670_pclk2 = PERIOD "ov7670_pclk2" 41.667 ns HIGH 50%
   INPUT_JITTER 100 ps;> [top.ucf(110)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
