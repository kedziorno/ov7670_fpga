INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clkcam', used in period specification
   'TS_clkcam', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_vga. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKDV: <TIMESPEC TS_clk251 = PERIOD "clk251" TS_clkcam * 4 HIGH 50%
   INPUT_JITTER 80 ps>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'ov7670_pclk1', used in period specification
   'TS_ov7670_pclk1', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_pclk1. The following
   new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP
   output(s): 
   CLK0: <TIMESPEC TS_clock3a = PERIOD "clock3a" TS_ov7670_pclk1 HIGH 50%
   INPUT_JITTER 100 ps>

INFO:NgdBuild:1222 - Setting CLKIN_PERIOD attribute associated with DCM instance
   DCM_vga to 10.000000 ns based on the period specification (<TIMESPEC
   TS_clkcam = PERIOD "clkcam" 10 ns HIGH 50% INPUT_JITTER 80 ps;>
   [top.ucf(105)]).
INFO:NgdBuild:1222 - Setting CLKIN_PERIOD attribute associated with DCM instance
   DCM_cam to 10.000000 ns based on the period specification (<TIMESPEC
   TS_clkcam = PERIOD "clkcam" 10 ns HIGH 50% INPUT_JITTER 80 ps;>
   [top.ucf(105)]).
WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value
   (20.8329999999999984) was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "DCM_pclk1".  This does not match the PERIOD constraint value (41.667 ns.). 
   The uncertainty calculation will use the non-default attribute value.  This
   could result in incorrect uncertainty calculated for DCM output clocks.
