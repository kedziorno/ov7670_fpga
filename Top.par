WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB /
   clock site pair. The clock component <clkcambuf_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y0>. The IO component <clkcam> is
   placed at site <U9>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <clkcam.PAD> allowing your design
   to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this
   override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error
   condition be corrected in the design.
WARNING:Place:1013 - A clock IOB / DCM component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / DCM
   site pair.  The clock component <DCM_pclk1> is placed at site <DCM_X2Y3>.  The clock IO/DCM site can be paired if
   they are placed/locked in the same quadrant.  The IO component <ov7670_pclk1> is placed at site <L16>.  This will not
   allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <ov7670_pclk1.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.
