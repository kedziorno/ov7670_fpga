WARNING:Place:1013 - A clock IOB / DCM component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / DCM
   site pair.  The clock component <DCM_pclk1> is placed at site <DCM_X1Y3>.  The clock IO/DCM site can be paired if
   they are placed/locked in the same quadrant.  The IO component <ov7670_pclk1> is placed at site <L16>.  This will not
   allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <ov7670_pclk1.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 128920 (Setup: 128920, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

WARNING:Par:468 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
   Route Static Timing Report"). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 5

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
